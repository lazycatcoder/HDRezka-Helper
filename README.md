   **HDrezka Helper** is a Google Chrome extension for HDrezka website. It automatically blocks ads and extracts direct links to movies, providing convenient access to content without distracting elements.

   The principle of operation is to track network requests that occur on the page while the video is loading. The extension determines the link to the movie being played, excluding unnecessary elements such as advertising banners and videos. The received link is transferred to the extension interface, from where it can be easily copied or used for its intended purpose. All this happens in the background, without interfering with the main viewing.

   The advantages of the **HDrezka Helper** extension are its simplicity and ease of use. The application uses a lightweight interface and tasks do not require strict settings.
